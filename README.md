- 👋 Hi, I’m @eishogun, the Raiden Shogun of Inazuma
- 👀 I’m interested in the pursuit of eternity and protecting my people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the Electro Archon's responsibilities and the balance between eternity and the well-being of my people.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow travelers to unravel the mysteries surrounding Inazuma and ensure its prosperity.
- 📫 You can reach me through the game world of Teyvat, but be warned, my responsibilities as the Electro Archon often keep me occupied.
